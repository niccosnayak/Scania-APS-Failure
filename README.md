# Scania-APS-Failure
The Air Pressure System (APS) is a system which generates pressurised air that are utilized in various functions in a truck, such as braking and gear changes.The dataset consists of data collected from the sensors of the failed Scania trucks.The dataset is crucial to the manufacturer as it allows to isolate components which caused the failure. This may help in avoiding failure during truck operation and thereby reducing maintenance cost. Our task is for the given data of failed scania trucks systems we have to predict whether the failure is caused due to the APS system or not.
